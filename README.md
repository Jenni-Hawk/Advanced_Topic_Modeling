# Advanced_Topic_Modeling
This project determines which type of modeling can achieve the best results when conducting topic modeling on a large corpus of text. This work compares deep learning with classic machine learning and a combination of deep learning with with classic learning. 
This project compares classic NLP machine learning algorithms, BERTopic, vs ChatGPT-4 when determining topics 
- Classic NLP vs BERTopic vs ChatGPT-4: Conduct an analysis of how each of these compare to each other on topic modeling. Determine how deep learning techniques can provide more insight versus Classic NLP.
