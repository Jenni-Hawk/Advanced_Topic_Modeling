# Advanced_Topic_Modeling
This project compares deep learning vs classic machine learning vs a combination of deep learning with classic learning for topic modeling on a large corpus. 
Specific algorithms involved in the research: LSA with TF-IDF, BERTopic, and ChatGPT-4.

- To measure how well a model is interpreting the text, I'll use an intrusion methodology to quantitatively measure performance.
